# function

In the javascript function definition, if there is no expression after the return statement, the function returns undefined.
The javascript function definition is executed without problems even if it appears first in the program.
The fucntion definition does not belong to the execution flow.
This is because all function definitions are put into memory before execution.
Calling a function in Javascript is much more costly than calling a loop.
